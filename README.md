# Book Discount Kata ðŸ“š

This project calculates the total price of a basket of programming books based on discounts for sets of different titles.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

There are 5 different books. You get a discount when you buy multiple **different** titles together:

- 2 different books: 5% discount
- 3 different books: 10% discount
- 4 different books: 20% discount
- 5 different books: 25% discount

Duplicate books get grouped optimally to maximize discounts.
